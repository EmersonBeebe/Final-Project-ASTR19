    "first, the numpy and sep modules are imported. then, more specific imports are made from astropy and matplotlib in order to process the data and generate an image representation. lines 12-14 are used to read and process the image.fits file in order to reorganize it as a 2d numpy array. The next section of code is using the abilities of the matplotlib module to graph/show the image generated by the processed data. the next section of code is used to standardize and measure the contribution from the background of the image so that the actual sources are more easily viewed. In the next section, the background is completely removed from the image, allowing the sources to be viewed easily. In the next section of code, the background of the image is subtracted from the points on the full image in order to show the sources of light in the image and to organize these sources into a list of objects. The next section of code is used to plot an ellipse around the perimeter of each source, making it more visible on the image. Then, the actual background of the image is removed until only an abstracted version is left and saved as a png where this png clearly shows the relative location and size of each object. the next sections of code are used to provide an example of the objects in this list"
